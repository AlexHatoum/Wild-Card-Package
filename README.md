# Wild-Card-Toolbox
This is the first iteration of the Wild Card Twin Modeling Package and toolbox.  WARNING: This is a work in progress and documentation is poor at this stage (with more to come!).  The package automates twin analyses over large datafiles. For now, downloading the "Functions" script and running it will put all the necessary functions in your environment.  
Many people interested in this package are likely looking at it's neuroimaging genetics applications.  I refer you to the step-by-step tutorial () for a run through (and example script) of how to run a whole-brain genetic analyses using twins.  The software is free and open source.
