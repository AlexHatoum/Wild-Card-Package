# Wild-Card-Package
This is the first iteration  of the Wild Card Twin Modeling package.  The package automates twin analyses over large datafiles. 
For now, downloading the attached script and running it will put all the necessary functions in your environment.  Many people interested 
in this package are likely looking at it's neuroimaging genetics applications.  I refer you to the step-by-step tutorial (link) for a run through 
(and example script) of how to run a whole-brain genetic analyses using twins.  The software is free and open source, but please cite (doi)
If you use this toolbox for your own analyses.
